.NET XML code documentation to Markdown converter written in F#

Very much WIP, but does work for [Monacs library documentation](https://monacslib.github.io/apidoc/), where it's used to generate Markdown converted then to documentation using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/).

Comments, proposals, PRs etc. are welcome :)
